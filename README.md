# Link-shortener-development-
Implement a Link Shortener System:

Develop a core functionality in Java to shorten long URLs and expand them back to their original form.
Uniqueness and Collision Handling:

Ensure that each generated short URL is unique.
Implement mechanisms to handle potential hash collisions.
Error Handling and User Feedback:

Include basic error handling for scenarios such as duplicate long URLs and invalid short URLs.
Provide meaningful feedback to users regarding their input.
Java Programming and Algorithmic Practice:

Gain practical experience in Java programming, working with data structures, and algorithmic problem-solving.
Requirements and Features
Programming Language:

Use Java as the primary language.
Core Functionality:

Create classes to manage URL shortening and expanding:
URL Shortener Class: This class will contain methods for generating short URLs and resolving them back to their original form.
Hash Function:

Implement a basic hash function to generate unique identifiers for the URLs.
Error Handling:

Handle errors such as:
Duplicate long URLs: Ensure that the same long URL generates the same short URL without creating duplicates.
Invalid short URLs: Detect and respond to short URLs that do not exist in the system.
Data Persistence (Optional):

Optionally, implement a mechanism to persist data, allowing link mappings to be maintained between sessions (e.g., using a file or a simple database).
User Interface:

Develop either a command-line interface (CLI) or a basic web interface to interact with users:
CLI: Allow users to input long URLs and receive short URLs, and vice versa.
Web Interface: Create a simple web page where users can input URLs and get the results.
Implementation Plan
Setup:

Set up your development environment with Java.
Create a new project for the Link Shortener application.
Design the Classes:

Design a URLShortener class with methods shortenURL(String longUrl) and expandURL(String shortUrl).
Consider additional helper methods or classes as needed.
Implement the Hash Function:

Implement a hash function to generate short URLs. Consider using Base62 encoding to create short and URL-friendly identifiers.
Collision Handling:

Implement a strategy for handling hash collisions, such as linear probing or chaining.
Error Handling:

Implement error handling for invalid inputs and duplicate URL scenarios.
User Interface:

For CLI:
Create a simple menu to take user inputs and display results.
For Web Interface (if chosen):
Use a simple web framework like Spring Boot to create a web page for user interaction.
Testing:

Write unit tests to ensure your methods work correctly.
Test edge cases and validate error handling.
Optional Data Persistence:

Implement a simple file-based or database-based persistence mechanism to save and load URL mappings.
